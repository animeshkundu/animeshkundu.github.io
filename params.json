  "body": "Most of the stuff that exist over here, were built simply because there was no solution or no easy solution out there. So most stuff over here automates something or makes doing something easier. Some of the stuff are boilerplate to speedup development of other things. \r\n\r\nI am a touch typist and huge terminal freak, so stuff present over here are mostly command line tools. Don't usually build GUI's unless it delivers a huge productivity boost. Like something, feel free to use, hack, improve it.\r\n\r\n## [Play and download torrents](https://github.com/animeshkundu/torrent-dl)\r\nPopcorn Time was/is a really cool solution to play torrents directly while its being downloaded in the background, if you can get one of the installers to work. I really love Peerflix, it just works.\r\n\r\nThis is a port of my beloved peerflix to python. You can simultaneously watch and download a torrent at the same time. It also supports random and incremental seek functionality of the media player.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Listen to audio only youtube](https://github.com/animeshkundu/youtube-audio)\r\nIf you are like me, chances are you listen to music on youtube more than video. \r\n\r\nI need my air to last through the day and also not burn through my FUP. Downloading and converting using a bash script wasn't really cutting it for me. Hence the extension both for firefox and chrome to mod youtube to my needs.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, safari wants me to pay 99$ to build a free extension. Some one please hire me to build it :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Set up a http media server for vlc](https://github.com/animeshkundu/media-server)\r\nI needed to watch movies and listen to songs wirelessly from a desktop which has all the hard disks attached to it. SMB, AFP, etc were too much of a hassle to set up and not to mention slow, jittery performance. I am looking at you Mac OS ( SMB 1 in 2016 ?). Hence the python script.\r\n\r\nShows the playlist directly in vlc. So that you can click and play :). Both random and incremental seek in vlc is supported. Playing directly in the browser is supported too.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Write micro services in php](https://github.com/animeshkundu/flake)\r\nApache was too much configuration and setup. Needed something like tornado for php to develop micro services in php fast. Boiler plate code.\r\n\r\nI needed to seriously stop writing framework glue and start writing logic fast. Something that tornado enables me to do very easily. PHP had nothing like that. \r\n\r\n\r\n## [File download accelerator](https://github.com/animeshkundu/file-dl) \r\nIf only axel2c provided a simple way of installation. Does not require root access or compilation or any of the nasty stuff. Clone and you are good to go.\r\n\r\nWritten as a library. `file-dl` is a simple wrapper over that. `accelerator` is the boiler plate for other tools.",
